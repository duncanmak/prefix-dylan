<H2>9. Equality and  <A NAME="Magnitude Comparison0">Magnitude Comparison</A>s</H2><p>
Dylan provides an identity function, as well as a group of equality and magnitude <A NAME="comparison0">comparison</A> functions that can be extended for user classes.  The methods =, /=, <, >, <=, and >= are defined in terms of binary= and binary&lt;.  By extending the behavior of binary= and binary<, programs can extend the behavior of the six methods.<p>
For the protocol to work, all methods on binary= and binary&lt; must preserve the following properties:<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Identity:<DD>If (id? a b), then (binary= a b).
<DT>Transitivity: <DD>If (binary&lt; a b) and (binary&lt; b c), then (binary&lt; a c).
<DT><DD>If (binary= a b) and (binary= b c), then (binary= a c).
<DT>Trichotomy: <DD>Exactly one of: (binary&lt; a b), (binary= a b), 
</DL>
(binary&lt; b a) always holds (on the assumption that these two operations are defined for the objects in question).  <A href="footnotes.html#fn22">FN22</A> , <A href="footnotes.html#fn23">FN23</A> <p>
In addition, classes which provide their own definition of binary= should provide a definition for =hash, if instances of the class will be used as keys in = hash tables.<p>

<PRE>
<b><A NAME="id?0">id?</A></b>   <i>object1 object2</i> #rest <i>objects</i>   ==><i>  boolean</i>	[Method]
</PRE>
id? returns true if <i>object1</i>, <i>object2</i>, and all the <i>objects </i>are all identical.  Otherwise, it returns false.<p>
Objects are considered identical if they are computationally equivalent.  That is, there is no way for any possible Dylan program to distinguish them. <A href="footnotes.html#fn24">FN24</A> <p>
<PRE>
<b><A NAME="=0">=</A></b>   <i>object1 object2</i> #rest <i>objects</i>   ==><i>  boolean</i>	[Method]
</PRE>
= returns true if every <i>object</i> is binary= to every other <i>object</i>.  Otherwise, = returns false.<p>
= is not guaranteed to return (for example, when called on circular structures or unbounded structures).<p>
= is a method, so you cant add other methods to it.  To extend the protocol, define methods on binary=.<p>
<PRE>
<b><A NAME="/=0">/=</A></b>   <i>object1 object2</i>   ==><i>  boolean</i>	[Method]
</PRE>
/= calls binary= on <i>object1</i> and <i>object2</i>.  Returns true if binary= returns false <A href="footnotes.html#fn25">FN25.<p>
/= is a method, so you cant add other methods to it.  To extend the protocol, define methods on binary=.<p></A>

<b><A NAME="binary=0">binary=</A><A HREF="ch12.html#binary=1">[next citation]</A></b>   <i>object1 object2</i>   ==><i>  boolean</i>	[Generic Function]
</PRE>
binary= is called by = and other comparison predicates.  Programs should not normally call this function directly.<p>
The predefined methods on binary= behave as follows:<p>
<UL>
<LI>	Collections are equal if they have the same keys and if the values of corresponding keys are =.  Keys are considered the same if they match according to the test used by the element method of the collection.  If the collections use a different test, then an error is signaled.  For example, an error would be signaled when trying to compare an = hash-table with an id? hash-table.  An error would not be signaled when comparing a sequence and an id? hash-table.<p>
	This implies that the collections are the same size.  For sequences, this means that elements at the same position are =.<p>
<LI>	Dotted lists are equal if the elements are equal and if the final cdrs are equal.<p>
<LI>	Built-in numbers are compared by mathematical value.<p>
<LI>	Other objects are compared with id?.
</UL>
If you define a method on binary= for a class of objects that you expect to use as keys in = tables, you must also define a corresponding method on =hash.  The details are described in the section on collections.<p>
<PRE>
<b><A NAME="=hash0">=hash</A></b>   <i>object</i>   ==><i>  integer</i>	[Generic Function]
</PRE>
returns a <A NAME="hash-code0">hash-code</A> for <i>object</i>.  If you define any methods for binary= and wish to use objects affected by that definition as keys in = tables, then you must define corresponding methods for =hash.<p>
The rule is that if two objects are =, then they must generate the same hash code when passed to =hash.<p>
The value returned by =hash must be a integer.<p></A>

<LI> Built-in real numbers are compared by mathematical value.

<LI> Strings are compared lexicographically, using binary&lt; on corresponding elements.  If one string is a strict prefix of the other, the shorter string is considered the smaller one.
