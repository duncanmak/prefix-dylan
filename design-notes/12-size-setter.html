<H1>#12: Size-Setter for Stretchy Sequences        (Addition)</H1>
<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note adds the generic function size-setter to the 
language specification, allowing the size of a stretchy sequence to 
be changed in a single operation.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Add a new generic function, with predefined methods for <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#stretchvecops">&lt;stretchyvector&gt;</a> and <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#dequeops">&lt;deque&gt;</a>, as follows:
<PRE>
size-setter sequence n   =&gt; n                [Generic Function]
</PRE>
Sets the size of sequence to be n.  sequence is destructively 
modified.
<P>
If n is less than or equal to the original size of sequence, then the 
first n elements of sequence are retained at the same positions.  If 
n is greater than the original size of sequence, then the previous 
elements of sequence are retained at the same positions, and enough 
new elements are added to reach the new size.  The value of each new 
element is the same as would have been used if sequence had been 
created with make, specifying size: n  but not fill:.
<P>
It is not specified how size-setter adds new elements to a sequence.  
In particular, size-setter is not required to call add! or any other 
predefined Dylan function.
