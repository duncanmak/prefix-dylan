Interactions between bind-exit and unwind-protect are complicated, 
especially when a non-local exit is taken during the execution of an 
unwind-protect cleanup form.  This design note replaces bind-exit and 
unwind-protect with a new block construct, and clarifies Dylan's 
behavior.
<HR>
On<a href = "../book.annotated/ch8.html#simpexit"> page 71 and 72</a> of the Dylan manual, replace bind-exit and 
unwind-protect with the following block construct.  Change all references 
to bind-exit and/or unwind-protect to refer to block as necessary 
throughout the manual.
<P><PRE>
block ([exit-var]) exprs  [cleanup cleanup-clauses]   [Special Form]

=&gt; values
</PRE>
block executes the exprs in sequence, and then the optional 
cleanup-clauses.  Normally, the value returned by block is the value of 
the last expr.  If there are no exprs, #f is returned.
<P>
If exit-var is provided, exit-var is bound to an exit procedure during 
the execution of the exprs and cleanup-clauses.  At any point in time 
before the last cleanup-clause returns, the exit procedure can be called.  
Calling the exit procedure has the effect of immediately terminating the 
execution of exprs.  The exit procedure accepts any number of arguments.  
These arguments are used as the return values of block.  Calling an exit 
procedure is known as performing a non-local exit.
<P>
Generally, the cleanup-clauses are guaranteed to be executed.  Even if 
one of the exprs is terminated by a non-local exit out of the block, the 
cleanup-clauses  are executed before the non-local exit can complete.  
For example, the following code fragment ensures that files are closed 
even in the case of an error causing a non-local exit:
<PRE>
block (return)
  open-files();
  ...
  if (error)
    return(#f);
  end if;
  ...
  result
cleanup
  close-files();
end block
</PRE>
However, if one of the cleanup-clauses is terminated by a non-local exit 
out of the block, any following cleanup-clauses within the same block are 
not executed.
<h3>
Restrictions on the use of exit procedures
</h3>
The exit procedure is a first-class object.  Specifically, it can be 
passed as an argument to functions, stored in data structures, etc.  Its 
use is not restricted to the lexical body of the establishing block (the 
block in which that exit procedure was established).  However, invocation 
of the exit procedure is valid only during the execution of the 
establishing block.  It is an error to invoke an exit procedure after its 
establishing block has returned, or after execution of the establishing 
block has been terminated by a non-local exit.
<P>
In the following example, the block establishes an exit procedure and 
binds bar to that exit procedure.  The block returns an anonymous method 
containing bar, which is then bound to foo.  Calling the foo method is an 
error because it is no longer valid to invoke bar after its establishing 
block returns.
<PRE>
? define foo
    block (bar)
       method (n) bar(n);
    end block;
  end foo.
? foo(5)
error or other undefined consequences
</PRE>
When an exit procedure is called, it initiates a non-local exit out of 
its establishing block.  Before the non-local exit can complete, however, 
the cleanup clauses of intervening blocks (blocks that have been entered, 
but not exited, since the establishing block was entered) must be 
executed, beginning with the most recently entered intervening block.   
Once the cleanup clauses of an intervening block have been executed, it 
is an error to invoke the exit procedure established by that block.  
Finally, the cleanup clauses of the establishing block are executed, 
further invocation of the exit procedure becomes invalid, and the 
establishing block returns with the values that were passed to the exit 
procedure.
<P>
During the process of executing the cleanup clauses of the intervening 
blocks, any valid exit procedure may be invoked and may interrupt the 
current non-local exit.
<HR>
<h3>
Examples
</h3>
The following expression is valid and returns 1.  The call to two does 
not complete because it is interrupted by a non-local exit when the 
cleanup is executed.
<PRE>
block (one)
  block (two)
    two(2);
  cleanup
    one(1);
  end;
  3
end
</PRE>
The following expression is valid and returns 2.  The exit procedure 
bound to exit is still valid when the cleanup is executed.
<PRE>
block (exit)
  exit(1);
cleanup
  exit(2);
end
</PRE>
The following expression returns 1 rather than 2.  The second cleanup is 
never executed.
<PRE>
block (exit)
  3;
cleanup
  exit(1);
  exit(2);
end
</PRE>
The following expression returns 2.  Nesting the blocks ensures that both 
cleanups will be executed.
<PRE>
block (exit)
  block ()
    3;
  cleanup
    exit(1);
  end;
cleanup
  exit(2);
end
</PRE>
The following expression is valid and returns 3.  The call to one does 
not destroy information needed to invoke two.
<PRE>
block (one)
  block (two)
    one(1);
  cleanup
    two(2);
  end;
  3
end
</PRE>
