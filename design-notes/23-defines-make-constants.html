This design note makes define-method more consistent with 
define-generic-function.  It also provides general declarative forms for 
defining constants and variables.
<HR>
Rename <a href = "../book.annotated/ch4.html#define1">define</a> to define-constant.
<P>
Specify that<a href = "../book.annotated/ch6.html#define-generic-function2"> define-generic-function</a>, <a href = "../book.annotated/ch6.html#define-class2"> define-class</a>, define-constant, and <a href = "../book.annotated/ch6.html#define-method2"> define-method</a> all create read-only variables.  These variables cannot be 
assigned new values. 
<P>
In addition, specify a new defining form, define-variable, which creates 
variables that are not read-only.  define-variable has the same syntax as 
define-constant.  There is no return value specified for define-variable.

<h3>
Notes
</h3>
In the Dylan book's definition of define-method, the statement "If the 
module variable variable-name is not already defined, it is first defined 
(as with define) ..." implies that define-method does not create 
read-only variables, which would be inconsistent with 
define-generic-function.  This Design Note clears up that inconsistency.
<P>
In addition, the Dylan book specifies that define-generic-function and 
define-class create read-only variables.  However, it does not specify a 
declarative way to create read-only variables in the general case.
