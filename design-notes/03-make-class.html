<H1>#3: Make Class Specification         (Addition)</H1>
<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note gives an expanded specification for &lt;class&gt; which 
enables new classes to be created at runtime, with make.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Replace the specification of &lt;class&gt; <a href = "../book.annotated/ch11.html#class-class0"> on page 91 of the Dylan manual</a> 
with the following:
<PRE>
&lt;class&gt;        [Abstract Class]
</PRE>
All classes (including &lt;class&gt;) are general instances of &lt;class&gt;.  
&lt;class&gt; is a subclass of &lt;type&gt;.
<P>
In most programs the majority of classes are created with defineclass.  However, there is nothing to prevent programmers from 
creating classes by calling make, for example, if they want to 
create a class without storing it in a module variable, or if they 
want to create new classes at runtime.
<P>
The class &lt;class&gt; supports the following init-keywords:
<DL>
<DT>superclasses:        <DD>Specifies the direct superclasses of the class.  
superclasses: should be a class or a sequence of classes.  The 
default value is &lt;object&gt;.  The meaning of the order of the 
superclasses is the same as in define-class.
<DT>debug-name:        <DD>Used only for debugging and display purposes.  The 
default is implementation-dependent.
<DT>slots:        <DD>A sequence of slot specs, where each slot-spec is a 
sequence of keyword/value pairs.
</DL>
The following keywords and corresponding values  are accepted by 
all implementations.  Implementations may also define additional 
keywords and values for use within slot specs.
<DL>
<DT>getter:        <DD>A generic function of one argument.  Unless the 
allocation of the slot is virtual, the getter method for the slot 
will be added to this generic function.  This option is required.
<DT>setter:        <DD>A generic function of two arguments.  Unless the 
allocation of the slot is virtual, the setter method for the slot 
will be added to this generic function.  There is no default.
<DT>type:        <DD>A type.  Values stored in the slot are restricted to be of 
this type.  The default value for this option is &lt;object&gt;.
<DT>init-value:        <DD>Supplies a default initial value for the slot.  This 
option cannot be specified along with init-function.  There is no 
default.
<DT>init-function:        <DD>A function of no arguments.  This function will 
be called to generate an initial value for the slot when new 
instances are created.  This option cannot be specified along with 
init-value.  There is no default
<DT>init-keyword:        <DD>A keyword.  This option permits an initial value 
for the slot to be passed to make, as a keyword argument using this 
keyword.  There is no default.  This option cannot be specified 
along with required-init-keyword:.
<DT>required-init-keyword:        <DD>A keyword.  This option is like initkeyword:, except it indicates an init-keyword that must be provided 
when the class is instantiated.  If make is called on the class and 
a required init-keyword is not provided, an error is signaled.  
There is no default.  This option cannot be specified if initkeyword:, init-value:, or init-function: is specified.
<DT>allocation:        <DD>One of the symbols instance, class, each-subclass, 
constant, or virtual, or an implementation defined symbol.  The 
meaning of this option is the same as for define-class.
</DL>

Examples:
<PRE>
(make &lt;class&gt;
      superclasses: &lt;object&gt;
      slots: `((getter: ,point-x
                setter: ,point-x-setter
                init-keyword: ,x:
                init-value: ,0
                type: ,&lt;integer&gt;)
               (getter: ,point-y
                setter: ,point-y-setter
                init-keyword: ,y:
                init-value: ,0
                type: ,&lt;integer&gt;)))

(make &lt;class&gt;
      superclasses: `(,&lt;input-stream&gt; ,&lt;output-stream&gt;)
      slots: `((getter: ,stream-cache
                setter: ,stream-cache-setter
                init-keyword: ,cache:)))
</PRE>
Or, in a different style:
<PRE>
(make &lt;class&gt;
      superclasses: &lt;object&gt;
      slots: (vector (vector getter: point-x
                             setter: point-x-setter
                             init-keyword: x:
                             init-value: 0
                             type: &lt;integer&gt;)
                     (vector getter: point-y
                             setter: point-y-setter
                             init-keyword: y:
                             init-value: 0
                             type: &lt;integer&gt;)))

(make &lt;class&gt;
      superclasses: (vector &lt;input-stream&gt; &lt;output-stream&gt;)
      slots: (vector (vector getter: stream-cache
                             setter: stream-cache-setter
                             init-keyword: cache:)))
