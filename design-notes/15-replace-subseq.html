<H1>#15: Replace-Subsequence! Different Sizes        (Change)</H1>
<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note extends the definition of replace-subsequence! to 
allow the old and new subsequences to have different sizes.  This 
change greatly increases the utility of replace-subsequence!, 
enabling it to be used for replace, insert and delete operations over 
any sequence.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Replace the definition of replace-subsequence! <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#replace-subsequence!0"> on page 108 of the Dylan book</a> with the following:
<PRE>
replace-subsequence! sequence insert-sequence 
                     #key start end =&gt;  result-sequence           [Generic Function]
</PRE>
This function returns a sequence with the same elements as sequence, 
except that elements of the indicated subsequence are replaced by all 
the elements of  insert-sequence.  The subsequence to be overridden 
begins at index start and ends at index end. If start is not 
supplied, it defaults to 0. If end is not supplied, it defaults to 
(size sequence ).  result-sequence  may or may not share structure 
with sequence , it may or may not be <a href = "../book.annotated/ch9.html#id?0">id?</a> to sequence , and sequence  
may or may not be modified by the operation.  result-sequence  will 
not share structure with insert-sequence.
