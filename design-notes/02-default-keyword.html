<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note adds a default: keyword argument to the 
specification of the functions  first, second, third, and last.  
This change removes a possible source of confusion by making these 
functions more consistent with the function element.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Add a default: keyword argument to the functions first, second, 
third, and last.  Change the description of first, second, and third 
<a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#first0">on page 110 of the Dylan manual</a> to read as follows:
<P>
Each of these functions returns the indicated element of the 
sequence.  If the sequence is too short to contain such an element, 
then the behavior depends on whether the default argument was 
supplied.  If the default argument was supplied, its value is 
returned; otherwise, an error is signaled.
<P>
Replace the second sentence of the description of last on page 110 of the manual</a> with the following:  
<P>
If the sequence is empty, then the behavior of last depends on 
whether it was called with a default  argument.  If the default  
argument was supplied, its value is returned; otherwise, an error is 
signaled.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Notes:
<P>
Many implementations will want to compile away the keyword argument.  
However, they should already have technology to do this for the 
implementation of element, so there isn't much added cost here.
<P>
This design note does not address the behavior of last on unbounded 
sequences, including the effect of the default: keyword when last is 
called on unbounded sequences.
