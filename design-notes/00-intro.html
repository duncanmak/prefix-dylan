<H1>Design Note Format</H1>
<P>
Each Design Note fits into one of the following categories:
<UL>
<LI> clarification:                This Design Note resolves an ambiguity or 
underspecification in the Dylan manual.
<LI> change:        This Design Note specifies an incompatible change.
<LI> addition:        This Design Note specifies a compatible extension.
</UL>
<P>
The first section of each Design Note contains the following parts: 
<OL>
<LI> the title of this Note
<LI> the category that this Note fits into
<LI> the version and date of this Design Note
<LI> a one-paragraph summary of the clarification, change, or addition 
specified by this Note.
</OL>
The second section of each Design Note contains the language 
specification itself.  This may be expressed as a change to the text 
of the manual, or as an independent section.  It often includes 
examples.
<P>
Some Design Notes have an additional section which may include 
implementation notes, further examples, or some of our reasons for 
making the change.
<P>
Throughout the Design Notes, the term parameter is used to mean 
formal parameter.  That is, a parameter is a local variable bound 
upon entry to a function.  The Design Notes use the term argument to 
describe what is sometimes called an actual parameter.  That is, an 
argument is an object that is passed as the value of a parameter.
<P>
The names of parameters are often descriptive of the type of value 
acceptable as a value of the parameter.  They will often match the 
names of classes, indicating a general instance of the class.  For 
example, number indicates a general instance of the class &lt;number&gt;, 
and string indicates a general instance of the class &lt;string&gt;.
<P>
The following notation is used to describe syntax forms:
<PRE>
        {...}      Curly braces indicate a group of items.

        {...}*     Curly braces followed by an asterisk indicate that the 
                   contents can appear zero or more times.

        {...}+     Curly braces followed by a plus sign indicate that the 
                   contents can appear one or more times.

        [...]      Square brackets indicate that the contents are optional.

        ... | ...  Items separated by a vertical bar are mutually exclusive.  
                   One or the other may appear.
</PRE>
We issue the Design Notes in plain text format as well as in 
PostScript.  In the PostScript format, we use a small number of 
typographic conventions to enhance readability:
<UL>
<LI>        Body text appears in Roman.
<LI>        First uses of terms appear in Bold.
<LI>        Text which appears as it would be entered in the computer 
appears in Courier.
<LI>        Formal parameters appear in Italic.
<LI>        Interactions between a user and a Dylan listener are shown in 
a mixture of Courier and Courier Oblique.  Courier shows the text 
entered by the user, and Courier Oblique shows the text printed by 
the listener.  The question mark used in these sections is the 
listener's prompt.
</UL>
The error messages in the Design Notes have been edited for brevity.  
The details of interactions with Dylan (prompt text, error message 
texts, etc.) may differ among implementations.
