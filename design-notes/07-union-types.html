<H1>#7: Union Types        (Addition)</H1>
<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note introduces a new facility for creating a union type 
as a union of two other types.   Union types are useful as slot 
specializers, and describe the return types of many common functions.  
For example, (union &lt;integer&gt; (singleton #f)) describes the return 
type of size.   
<P>
Union types are not classes.  See <a href= "05-type-system.html">Dylan Design Note #5: 
Regularization of the Type System</a> for a general description of types 
that are not classes.

<P>
Add <a href= "../book.annotated/ch6.html#funclass">a new facility</a> for creating a type as a union of two other types.
<P>
union type1 type2  #key   =&gt; type        [Method]
<P>
Returns a type whose instances are each an instance of type1 or 
type2.  No keyword arguments are accepted (the union method for 
sequences has a test: argument, hence the #key in the parameter 
list).  This type is not instantiable.
<P>
For example:
<PRE>
The result of size is of type (union &lt;integer&gt; (singleton #f)).
The result of find-method is of type (union &lt;method&gt; (singleton #f)).
The first argument to union must be of type (union &lt;sequence&gt; 
&lt;type&gt;).
</PRE>
If x is an object, s1, ..., sm, t1, ..., tn are non-union types, and 
the notation (union* t1 ... tn) stands for any arrangement of nested 
calls of union, where none of the arguments is a subtype of any 
other, and none of the arguments form an exhaustive partition of any 
other type:
<PRE>
(union t1 t1) = t1

(union t1 t2) = (union t2 t1)

(union t1 (union t2 t3)) = (union (union t1 t2) t3)

(union t1 t2) = t2 when (subtype? t1 t2)

(union t1 t2) = t3 when t1 and t2 form an exhaustive partition of t3
e.g. (union &lt;integer&gt; &lt;ratio&gt;) = &lt;rational&gt;.

(instance? x (union* t1 ... tn)) 
         iff (or (instance? x t1) ... (instance? x tn))

(subtype? (union* t1 ... tn) s1) 
         iff (and (subtype? t1 s1) ... (subtype? tn s1))

(subtype? s1 (union* t1 ... tn)) 
         iff (or (subtype? s1 t1) ... (subtype? s1 tn))

(subtype? (union* s1 ... sm) (union* t1 ... tn))
  iff (and (or (subtype? s1 t1) ... (subtype? s1 tn))
             ...
             (or (subtype? sm t1) ... (subtype? sm tn)))
</PRE>

Notes:
<P>
The union, <a href = "../book.annotated/ch11.html#instance?0">instance?</a>, and <a href = "05-type-system.html">subtype?</a> methods for unions are 
straightforward to implement.  Adding unions to the method dispatch 
mechanism simply makes a union-specialized method applicable to each 
type in the union.
<P>
Dispatching to a union-specialized method should be no slower than 
dispatching to separate methods applicable to each type in the union, 
and should take less space.
