<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note adds a specification for the generic function last-setter, consistent with the setters for first, second, third, and 
element.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Specify the generic function <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#last0">last-setter</a>, as follows:
<PRE>
last-setter mutable-sequence new-value =&gt; new-value [Generic Function]
</PRE>
Replaces the last element of mutable-sequence with new-value.  new-value must obey any type restrictions for elements of mutable-sequence.  An error is signaled if mutable-sequence is empty or 
unbounded.
<PRE>
? (define my-list (list 1 2 3))
;unspecified
? my-list
1 2 3
? (set! (last my-list) 4)
4
? my-list
1 2 4
? (define my-empty-vector (vector))
;unspecified
? my-empty-vector
#()
? (set! (last my-empty-vector) 0)
;error
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
Notes:
<P>
The following is a portable implementation:
<PRE>
(define-method last-setter ((s &lt;mutable-sequence&gt;) new)
  (case (size s)
    ((0 #f)       ;check for empty or unbounded sequence
     (error "last-setter of empty sequence ~S" s))
    (else: (bind ((first-state (initial-state s)))
             (bind-methods ((loop (trail advance)
                              (bind ((next (next-state s advance))
                                     (trail (next-state s trail)))
                                (if next
                                  (loop trail next)
                                  (set! (current-element s trail)
                                        new)))))
               (loop (initial-state s)
                     (next-state s first-state)))))))
</PRE>
