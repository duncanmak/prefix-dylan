<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
In this design note, Dylan's specification of the &lt;list&gt; type is 
made more consistent with the rest of the language, mysterious 
abbreviations and redundant list-only operations are removed, and 
handling of improper lists is clarified.  These changes make the 
language more accessible to our primary audience of programmers who 
have not used dynamic languages before.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Make the following changes to the Dylan manual, <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#listops">pages 115-117</a>:  
<P>
Rename cons to pair.  Rename car and cdr to head and tail 
respectively, and rename the corresponding setters to head-setter 
and tail-setter.  Remove the compound functions caar through cdddr 
and the corresponding setter operations.
<P>
Remove list*.  Use (pair a (pair b c)) instead of (list* a b c).  
<P>
Remove find-pair.
<P>
Remove append.  Use concatenate instead.  Replace the definition of 
concatenate <a href= "../book.annotated/ch12.html#concatenate1">on page 108</a> with the following:
<PRE>
concatenate sequence1 #rest sequences=&gt; new-sequence        [Generic Function]
</PRE>
concatenate returns a new sequence containing all the elements of 
all the sequences, in order.  new-sequence may non-destructively 
share structure with any of the input sequences, but it is not 
guaranteed to do so.
<P>
Specify that member? on lists always returns a boolean.  Remove the 
definition of member? on page 117, and replace the definition of 
member? <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#member?0">on page 103</a> with the following:
<P>
member? value collection #key test =&gt; boolean        [Generic Function]
member? returns #t if and only if collection contains value (as 
determined by test, which defaults to id?).  The test function may 
be non-commutative: it is always called with value as its first 
argument and an element from collection as its second argument.
<PRE>
? (define flavors '(pistachio chocolate pumpkin))
flavors
? (member? 'chocolate flavors)
#t
? (member? 'banana flavors)
#f
</PRE>
Add the following description of the class &lt;empty-list&gt;:
<PRE>
&lt;empty-list&gt;        [Sealed Instantiable Class]
</PRE>
The class &lt;empty-list&gt; has only one instance, the empty list.  The 
empty list is a direct instance of &lt;empty-list&gt; and an indirect 
instance of &lt;list&gt;.  Note that &lt;empty-list&gt; is not id? to 
(singleton '()).
<PRE>
? (object-class '())
&lt;empty-list&gt;
? (define-method f (x &lt;empty-list&gt;) 1)
? (define-method f (x (singleton '())) 2)
? (define-method f (x &lt;list&gt;) 3)
? (f '())
2
? (f '(chocolate vanilla))

</PRE>
An improper list is a list that is not terminated by the empty 
list, either because it is terminated by something that is not a 
list, or because it is circular and thus non-terminating.  Except 
when their behavior on improper lists is documented explicitly, 
collection or sequence functions are not guaranteed to return an 
answer when an improper list is used as a collection or a sequence.  
At the implementation's option, these functions may return the 
correct result, signal a &lt;type-error&gt;, or  (in the case of a 
circular list) fail to return.
<PRe>
? (size '(1  2 . 3)) 
   ; signals a &lt;type-error&gt; (there is no correct result)
? (size (bind ((x (pair 1 1))) (set! (tail x) x)))
#f
? (member? 1 (bind ((x (pair 1 1))) (set! (tail x) x)))
#t ; may also signal a &lt;type-error&gt; or never return
? (member? 0 (bind ((x (pair 1 1))) (set! (tail x) x)))
#f ; may also signal a &lt;type-error&gt; or never return
? (element '(1 2 . 3) 1)
2  ; may also signal a &lt;type-error&gt; 
? (element '(1 2 . 3) 2)
   ; signals a key out of range error or a &lt;type-error&gt;
? (element '(1 2 . 3) 2 default: 0)
0  ; may also signal a &lt;type-error&gt;

Notes
<P>
The mysterious abbreviations car and cdr have no meaning to most 
people.  The name cons does not have an apparent meaning either, 
and it is not obviously related to the class, &lt;pair&gt;, that it 
instantiates.
<P>
The compound functions caar through cdddr seem like holdovers from 
the days before object-oriented programming, when data structures 
were built up from pairs, using these functions as accessors, and 
not encapsulated in abstractions.
<P>
list* is an obscure function.  It does the same thing as cons when 
called with two arguments, so one of them is redundant.
<P>
append does almost the same thing as concatenate, making it seem 
redundant.  The result of append is specified to share structure 
with the last argument; the book does not specify whether the 
result of concatenate must, might, or must not share structure with 
an argument.  We feel that the decision whether to share structure 
in concatenate is regarded as an implementation optimization 
decision, rather than language semantics.  This assumes that users 
want structure-sharing only to optimize space, not because they 
rely on modifying the shared structure.
