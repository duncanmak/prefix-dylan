This Design Note specifies a syntax and semantics for module defining 
forms, which further documents <a href = "../book.annotated/ch5.html">the description of modules</a> found in the 
Dylan book.  
<HR>
<h3>
Overview
</h3>
A module establishes a mapping from variable names to variables (memory 
locations containing values).  It does this in one of two ways: a 
variable can be owned by the module, or the module may import variables 
exported by another module by using the other module.  Modules export 
variables to make them accessible to other modules.  Only exported 
variables can be imported by other modules.
<P>
Within a given module, a variable name refers to at most one variable.  
It is an error to create or import two or more different variables with 
the same name in a single module.  If a name does refer to a variable, 
the variable is said to be accessible from the module.  Each variable is 
owned by exactly one module, but it can be accessible from many modules.
<P>
Owned variables are created by the create: keyword argument to 
<tt>define-module</tt> and in some cases by definitions associated with a module.
<P>
Dylan includes two kinds of definitions.  <a href = "../book.annotated/ch2.html#structure">Explicit definitions</a> are 
created by <tt>define-constant, define-variable, define-generic-function</tt>, and the class name in <tt>define-class</tt>.  Implicit definitions are created by <tt>define-method</tt> and the slot specifications of <tt>define-class</tt>.
<P>
Definitions are used both to create variables and to provide values for 
variables.  An explicit definition performed on a variable which was not 
imported creates an owned variable and provides a value for it.  An 
explicit definition performed on a variable which was imported just 
provides a value for the variable.  An implicit definition has the same 
behavior, but only if there is no explicit definition for the variable.  
(If there is an explicit definition for the variable, then the implicit 
definition does not create the variable, nor does it provide the value 
for it.)
<P>
There must be exactly one explicit definition for each module variable, 
with the exception that the explicit definition can be left out if there 
are one or more implicit definitions.  Any module variable whose value is 
a generic function can have any number of implicit definitions.
<h3>
Programs, module declarations, and expressions
</h3>
A Dylan program is composed of expressions.  Each expression is 
associated with a module.  Within an expression, variables are referenced 
by variable names.  The module associated with the expression provides 
the mapping from variable name to variable used within the expression.  
It is an error to reference a variable name for the purpose of getting or 
setting its value if the variable name does not designate either a 
variable locally bound with a scope that includes the reference or a 
variable accessible in the associated module. 
<P>
A technique for associating an expression with a module is described in 
the <a href = "33-source-file-headers.html">Design Note #33: Headers for Dylan Source Files (Addition)</a>.
<P>
Module declarations are expressions.  Like other defining forms, module 
declarations are only allowed at top level or inside of begin.  The 
variable names in module declarations are relative either to the module 
being declared or to a module that it uses, and thus are not affected by 
the module declaration's associated module.  A module declaration can be 
associated with any module where <tt>define-module</tt> has its normal meaning.
<P>
Before an expression can be compiled, the module declaration for the 
module associated with the expression must be compiled and then made 
available to the development environment in an implementation-defined 
way.
<P>
Macros can expand into module declarations.  This happens during 
compilation of the module declaration.
<h3>
Module declarations
</h3>
Modules are defined by <tt>define-module</tt> forms.
<PRE>
define-module module-name { module-clause }*  [Module Declaration]
</PRE>
where each <tt>module-clause</tt>  is either a use clause,  a create clause,  or an export clause  (see below).
<P>
This form defines the module with the given name.  It describes which 
modules are used by the module being defined, which variables are 
imported from the used modules, and which variables are exported by the 
module being defined.
<P>
<tt>module-name</tt>  has the same syntax as identifiers and symbols.  Module 
names are global in scope.  Under this proposal, entire programs are 
compiled as a unit and module names are global to that unit.  Though they 
are not part of this proposal, extensions to allow separate compilation 
will be considered in the future.  The namespace of module names is 
distinct from that of variables.  No variable with the name <tt>module-name</tt> is created.
<h3>
Use clauses
</h3>
There is one or more use-clause  for each module used by the module being 
defined.  Each use-clause  has the form:
<PRE>
(use used-module-name #key import export prefix exclude rename)
</PRE><P>
<tt>used-module-name</tt>  is the name of a module to be used.  By default all 
exported variables from the used module are imported by the module being 
defined, under the same name they had in the used module.
<P>
When there are multiple use clauses using the same module, the set of 
imported variables is the union of those specified by all the use 
clauses.  Some variables may be imported under more than one variable 
name.
<P>
The keyword options are used to prevent some variables from being 
imported, to give some or all variables different names in the new 
module, and to re-export variables which were imported from a used 
module.  Each of these keyword options applies within the scope of the 
particular use clause, and does not affect the behavior of other use 
clauses (even if the other use clauses indicate the same module).
<PRE>
import: ({variable-name  |  (old-name =&gt; new-name) }*) | all
</PRE><P>
Indicates which variables are to be imported from the module being used.  
The default is all, meaning that all the variables exported by the used 
module should be imported.  When =&gt; appears in an import-option, it 
specifies both an import and a rename.  In other words, 
<PRE>
        import: (foo =&gt; bar)</PRE>
is simply an abbreviation for 
<PRE>
        import: (foo), rename: (foo =&gt; bar)
</PRE>
and means exactly the same thing.  
<PRE>
exclude: ({variable-name}*)
</PRE>
Indicates variables which should not be imported.  This keyword can only 
be used if import: is all.  The default for the exclude: keyword is ().
<PRE>
prefix: string
</PRE>
Prepends string  to the names of variables as they are imported from the 
used module.  This option can be overridden for a particular variable by 
using the rename: keyword for that variable.  The default value is "".
<PRE>
rename: ({(old-name =&gt; new-name)}*)
</PRE>
Used to override both the import: keyword and the prefix: keyword.  The 
variables named are imported, regardless of whether the import: keyword 
indicates they should be imported.  <tt>old-name</tt> indicates the name of the
variable in the module being used; <tt>new-name</tt>  indicates the name to be 
given to the variable in the module being defined.  The prefix: keyword 
of the use clause is ignored for variables specified by the <tt>rename</tt>: 
keyword.  The default value for the rename: keyword is ().
<PRE>
export: ({variable-name}*) | all
</PRE>
Specifies variables which should be exported from the module being 
defined.  Each of these variables must have been imported by this use 
clause.  <tt>variable-name</tt>  is the name of the variable in the module being defined.  It is also the name under which the variable will be exported.  
It is allowed for the same <tt>variable-name</tt>  to appear more than once, as
this is sometimes useful for documentation purposes.  all indicates that 
all the variables imported by this use clause should be exported.  The 
default value for the export: keyword is ().
<h3>
Exporting owned variables
</h3>
A module export clause  has the following syntax:
<PRE>
(export {variable-name }*)
</PRE>
This option specifies that the named variables are to be exported from 
the module being defined.  Each <tt>variable-name</tt>  is the name of a variable to export.  These variables must be defined by a defining form in the module being defined.  It is an error if any of the variables were 
imported from other modules.   It is allowed for the same name to appear 
more than once, since this is sometimes useful for documentation 
purposes.
<P>
A module create clause  has the following syntax:
<PRE>
(create {variable-name }*)
</PRE>
This option specifies that the named variables are to be created in and 
exported from the module being defined.  A <tt>variable-name</tt>  is the name of a variable to create and export.  These variables must not be defined by 
a defining form in the module being defined, and they must be defined by 
a module which uses the module being defined.  It is an error if any of 
the variables were imported from other modules.   It is allowed for the 
same name to appear more than once, since this is sometimes useful for 
documentation purposes.
<h3>
Circular uses and imports
</h3>
Circular use relationships among modules are not allowed.  The graph of 
the module-uses-module relation must be a directed acyclic graph.

<h3>
Examples</h3>
<PRE>
define module graphics
  use dylan;
  create draw-line,
         erase-line,
         invert-line,
         skew-line
         frame-rect,
         fill-rect,
         erase-rect,
         invert-rect;
end module graphics;

define module lines
  use dylan;
  use graphics,
        import: (draw-line,
               erase-line,
               invert-line,
               skew-line);
end module lines;

define module rectangles
  use dylan;
  use graphics,
        prefix: "graphics$",
        exclude: (skew-line);
end module rectangles;

define module dylan-gx
  use dylan, export: all;
  use graphics,
        rename: (skew-line =&gt; warp-line),
      export: all;
end module dylan-gx;
</PRE>
The modules created by the above module declarations would have access to 
variables with the following names:
<PRE>
graphics        draw-line
                erase-line
                invert-line
                skew-line
                frame-rect
                fill-rect
                erase-rect
                invert-rect
                plus all the variables in the Dylan module

lines           draw-line
                erase-line
                invert-line
                skew-line
                plus all the variables in the Dylan module

rectangles      graphics$draw-line
                graphics$erase-line
                graphics$invert-line
                graphics$frame-rect
                graphics$fill-rect
                graphics$erase-rect
                graphics$invert-rect
                plus all the variables in the Dylan module

dylan-gx        draw-line
                erase-line
                invert-line
                warp-line
                frame-rect
                fill-rect
                erase-rect
                invert-rect
                plus all the variables in the Dylan module
</PRE>
The lines and rectangles modules do not export any variables.  They are 
presumably used to provide definitions for the variables created and 
exported by the graphics modules.  The difference between the graphics 
module and the dylan-gx module is that one variable is renamed, and the 
dylan-gx module exports the variables which it imports from the dylan 
module, while the graphics module does not.
