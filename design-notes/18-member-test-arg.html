<H1>#18: Member? Intersection Test Arg        (Clarification)</H1>
<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note clarifies that the &lt;range&gt; methods for member? and 
intersection support a test: keyword argument, which defaults to id?.  
This makes the &lt;range&gt; methods consistent with the definitions for 
these generic functions.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Replace the definition of member? <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#member?2">on page 118</a> with the following:
<PRE>
member? val range #key test =&gt; boolean        [G. F. Method]
</PRE>
member? generally terminates when given a range value, even if range 
is unbounded.  However, if range is unbounded, this method is 
guaranteed to terminate only if test is <a href = "../book.annotated/ch9.html#id?0">id?</a> (the default).
<P>
Replace the definition of intersection <a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#intersection2">on page 119</a> with the 
following:
<PRE>
intersection range1 range2 #key test =&gt; range        [G. F. Method]
</PRE>
intersection applied to two ranges and a test of id? (the default) 
will produce a range as the result, even though the <a href = "../book.annotated/ch11.html#class-for-copy0">class-for-copy</a> of 
a range is not &lt;range&gt;.  If either range1 or range2 is unbounded, 
this method is guaranteed to terminate only if the test is id?.
<P>

Examples:
<PRe>
? (member? 1 (range from: 0.0 up-to: 10.0 by: .5) test: =)
#t
? (intersection (range from: -5 up-to 10)
                (range from: 1.0 up-to 15.0)
                test: =)
{range 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}
</PRe>
The return value contains integers in the second example because the 
elements are taken from the first argument to intersection.  This is 
consistent with the definition of intersection<a href ="../book.annotated/ch12.html#intersection1"> on page 107 of the 
Dylan manual</a>.
