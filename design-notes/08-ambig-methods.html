Version 1, March 1993
<P>
Sometimes it is not clear which of two methods is the most specific 
for a particular function call.  This is a particular problem for 
non-class types because it is possible for an object to be an 
instance of two disjoint types, such as (limited &lt;integer&gt; min: 0) 
and (limited &lt;integer&gt; max: 10).  This design note requires Dylan to 
signal an error in such cases.

Method Dispatch Ambiguity
<P>
Sometimes it is not clear which of two methods is the most specific 
for a particular function call.    This section does not address what 
happens when t1 and t2 are both classes; it applies when either t1 or 
t2 or both is not a class.
<P>
If f is a generic function having methods m1 and m2, we say that it 
is ambiguous which of m1 and m2 is the most specific when all of the 
following are true:
<UL>
<LI> f  is called with some object x as the argument in a 
particular position
<LI> m1 and m2 have types t1 and t2 as parameter specializers in 
that position
<LI> x is an instance of both t1 and t2
<LI> t1 and t2 are disjoint (neither is a subtype of the other)
</UL>
Dylan signals an error when a generic function is called and it is 
ambiguous which method is the most specific, or when next-method is 
called and it is ambiguous which method is the next most specific.

Notes:
<P>
The Dylan book doesn't say what happens in this case (page 82 only 
addresses the case where one specializer is a singleton or a subclass 
of the other).   We needed to define how Dylan should handle these 
cases, or we couldn't coherently add more non-class types to Dylan.  
CLOS has a rule defining how to choose one method as more specific, 
using the class precedence list based on the order in which multiple 
superclasses are listed in the define-class, but the rule does not 
extend nicely from classes to parameterized types and has frequently 
been criticized as obscure and unhelpful.  By requiring Dylan to 
signal an error, we prevent programmers from depending on what is 
essentially an arbitrary choice.
