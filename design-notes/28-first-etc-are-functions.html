</PRE>
The functions first, second, third, and their associated setter functions 
are specified as generic functions on sequences.   This design note 
changes them to functions.
<HR>
Change<a href = "../book.annotated/ch12.html#first0"> the following functions</a> currently documented as generic functions 
to instead be functions with the indicated definitions:
<PRE>
first sequence #key default =&gt; value
second sequence #key default =&gt; value
third sequence #key default =&gt; value
</PRE>
Each of these functions returns the indicated element of the sequence, by 
calling element with the supplied arguments and the corresponding index.
<PRE>
first-setter sequence new-value =&gt; new-value
second-setter sequence new-value =&gt; new-value
third-setter sequence new-value =&gt; new-value
</PRE>
Each of these functions sets the indicated element of the sequence and 
returns the new value, by calling element-setter with the supplied 
arguments and the corresponding index.

Notes
</h3>
The functions first, second, third, and their associated setter functions 
are specified as generic functions on sequences.  It would be a serious 
problem if any of them should differ from a call to element or 
element-setter (as appropriate) with the corresponding integer key.  The 
existence of these functions without any specified methods makes it 
difficult for programmers to know whether they need to explicitly define 
additional methods for these functions that are applicable to new 
sequence classes.
