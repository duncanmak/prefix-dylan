<H1>#10: Element-Setter Signals Error        (Clarification)</H1>
<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
It is an error if element-setter cannot successfully set the element 
of a sequence.  This design note requires an error to be signaled in 
that case, preventing programs from silently returning an incorrect 
result or otherwise failing.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Specify that if element-setter cannot successfully set the element of 
a sequence, it should signal an error.  The second paragraph of the 
description of element-setter on <a href ="../book.annotated/ch12.html#(setter element)4">page 127 of the Dylan manual</a> should 
be changed to read, "An error is signaled if a program calls elementsetter with a key that is not already a key to collection, unless the 
collection supports the dynamic addition of keys and adds the key and 
new-value."
