<H1>#20: New Syntax for Setter Variables        (Change)</H1>
<P>
Version 1, March 1993
<P>
This design note changes the syntax for setter variables.  In the 
revised syntax, the setter corresponding to the getter foo is named 
foo-setter rather than (setter foo).  This removes the special case 
syntax for setters so that all variable names are symbols.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Specify that setter variable names are symbols, just like getter 
variable names, and are derived by appending "-setter" to the 
corresponding getter variable name.  
<P>
Update all examples in the Dylan book that involve setter variables.  
For example, the table of getters and setters <a href = "../book.annotated/ch3.html#getter0"> on page 26</a> should be 
changed to:
<PRE>
window-position   window-position-setter
window-color      window-color-setter
table-size        table-size-setter
</PRE>
Rename all setter variables that are part of the language 
specification in the Dylan book, as well as any other variables that 
have been added to the language or that exist in implementations and 
libraries.
<PRE>
(setter aref)             =&gt;       aref-setter
(setter current-element)  =&gt;       current-element-setter
(setter element)          =&gt;       element-setter
(setter first)            =&gt;       first-setter
(setter second)           =&gt;       second-setter
(setter third)            =&gt;       third-setter
</PRe>
Remove all special case discussions of setter variables and setter 
from the language specification.
